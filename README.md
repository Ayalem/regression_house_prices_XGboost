# 🏠 House Prices Prediction with XGBoost

This project focuses on predicting house prices using machine learning, specifically the **XGBoost** regression algorithm. It is based on the Kaggle dataset: *House Prices - Advanced Regression Techniques*.

## 📌 Overview

The goal is to build a regression model that accurately predicts house sale prices using various features such as location, size, condition, and more. The pipeline includes data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and prediction generation.

## 🧠 Approach

- Handle missing values and categorical variables  
- Feature selection and transformation
- Feature engineering 
- Train an XGBoost Regressor model  
- Generate predictions on unseen data  

## 📊 Dataset

- **Source**: [Kaggle House Prices Competition](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques)  
- `train.csv`: Includes house features and sale prices  
- `test.csv`: Includes house features only  

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Ayalem/regression_house_prices_XGboost.git
   cd regression_house_prices_XGboost
   ```

2. **Create a virtual environment**

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate   # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```



3. **Launch the notebook**

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

   Open the notebook for step-by-step analysis and training.
